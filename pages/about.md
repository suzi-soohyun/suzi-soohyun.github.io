# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
I'm a Master student at the Technical University of Munich, Germany.<br>
I see life as a learning journey and my biggest lessons have come from the people I've met along the way.<br>

I work on the intersection of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.<br>
Contact me by email below or on LinkedIn.
